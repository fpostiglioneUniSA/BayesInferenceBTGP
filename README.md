# BayesInferenceBTGP
Bayesian Inference for BTGP degradation process

Launch "BugsBTGPsampling.R" after selecting the number of chains, between 1 and 3 (this version is for Micorsoft Windows only).
The code in "BTGP_BayesAnalysis.R" will provide the results of the Section "Numerical application".

To change priors, modify the OpenBUGS file "BoundedTransfGamma_wlimGamma_bGamma_betaUnifVague_aUnifVague.txt"
Note that "wlim" is now called "U".
